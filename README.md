# fCC-musicPlayer
Adjusted code-along with freeCodeCamp Music Player task

The goal of this project is to teach basic string and array methods. By the end of the project, the music player should be able to play, pause, skip, and shuffle songs.

The HTML and CSS were provided by freeCodeCamp, however I will be adjusting the CSS to create my own design after I've completed the lesson (which is JavaScript focused).
